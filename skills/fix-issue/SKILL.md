Fix GitHub Issue #$ARGUMENTS.

## 1. Read issue

```bash
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --repo <canonical>
```

Understand the full context: problem description, acceptance criteria, linked PRs, and discussion. Follow linked issues, referenced PRs, and external documentation to build complete understanding.

## 2. Detect remotes

Determine the canonical remote and PR target:

- If a git remote named `upstream` exists, use it as the canonical remote. Fetch from it, base branches on it, and submit PRs to it.
- If no `upstream` remote exists, fall back to `origin`.

Resolve the canonical repo's `owner/name` from the remote URL and store it. Use `--repo <owner/name>` on every `gh` command.

Run `git fetch <canonical-remote>` to ensure up-to-date refs.

## 3. Research (if needed)

If the issue references unfamiliar APIs, libraries, error messages, or domain concepts, search for official documentation and known solutions before planning. Skip for straightforward bugs where the fix is clear from the codebase alone.

## 4. Plan (approval gate)

Write a PRD covering:

- Issue requirements summary
- Every file to create or modify (with file:line references)
- Approach and key design decisions
- Risks or open questions

**Stop and wait for user approval. Do not proceed until the user affirms (e.g., "approved", "go", "lgtm").**

## 5. Create branch

Determine the branch prefix from issue type:

- `fix/` for bugs
- `feat/` for features
- `refactor/` for refactors
- `docs/` for documentation
- When ambiguous, use `fix/`

Create a branch named `{prefix}issue-$ARGUMENTS` based on `<canonical-remote>/<default-branch>`.

## 6. Implement

Implement the plan across all necessary files. Follow the project's CLAUDE.md standards. Keep changes minimal and focused on the issue requirements — no speculative features.

Tests are part of implementation, not a separate step. Add tests for the changed behavior alongside the code changes.

When stuck — a confusing error, an unfamiliar API, or an approach that isn't working — search for solutions rather than spinning.

## 7. Quality gate (first pass)

### 7a. Discover project checks

CI is the source of truth. Before running anything, read the project's CI configuration to learn what the project actually runs.

1. Read `.github/workflows/` for the main CI workflow. Extract:
   - Test commands with feature flags
   - Lint/format commands with non-default flags
   - Codegen sync checks (commands followed by `git diff --exit-code`)
   - Docs build commands
2. Read `Makefile` or `justfile` if present. Cross-reference targets used in CI.
3. Read project CLAUDE.md for project-specific quality gates.

Store discovered commands. They override fallback defaults.

### 7b. Run the quality pipeline

Detect the project language from manifest files. A project may use multiple languages; run checks for each.

Run in this order, using CI-discovered commands when available:

1. **Build** — compile or bundle
2. **Test** — full suite with CI's feature flags
3. **Lint and format** — fix issues
4. **Extended checks** — per-language extras
5. **Codegen sync** — run discovered codegen commands, verify `git diff --exit-code`. Regenerate stale files if needed.
6. **Docs build** — if changes touch docs and a build command exists

For fallback commands when CI doesn't specify what to run, see `references/quality-gate-defaults.md`.

Iterate on failures until green.

## 8. Self-review

Review your own diff against the base branch. Rank every finding:

- **P1** — blocks merge (correctness bugs, security issues)
- **P2** — important (missing error handling, test gaps, logic flaws)
- **P3** — nice to have (style, naming, minor simplifications)

## 9. Fix findings

Address all P1–P3 findings. For each finding, either:

- **Fix it** — apply the change
- **Dismiss it** — explain why it's a false positive or not worth the churn

After fixing, re-read the diff of changes made in this step and verify each fix is correct and doesn't introduce regressions.

## 10. Quality gate (second pass)

Re-run the full quality pipeline from step 7b. Iterate until clean.

## 11. Ship

Invoke `/vc-ship`. The PR description should:

- Reference the issue with `Closes #$ARGUMENTS` (or `Refs #` if it doesn't fully close it)
- Map changes back to the issue requirements
